# FaceTrackNoIR UDP Protocol C-Sharp

Sample C#, Visual Studio, .Net Framework project file to use the facetracknoir udp protocol. You can use this project to create your own Face Tracker.

I use this as a base project to create my own head tracking system with an 'Atmel AVR microcontroller' and the 'GY-80 10DOF' board.
