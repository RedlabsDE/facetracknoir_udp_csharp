# FaceTrackNoIR UDP Protocoll C-Sharp

Sample C#, Visual Studio, .Net Framework project file to use the facetracknoir udp protocoll. You can use this project to create your own FaceTracker.

I use this as a base project to create my own headtracking system with an 'Atmel AVR microcontroller' and the 'GY-80 10DOF' board.
